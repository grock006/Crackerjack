		<p>Crackerjack is a web application built with the intention of creating a “Rotten Tomatoes” style ranking system for restaurants. It uses the Nokogiri gem and Readability Parser API to scrape Google search results for restaurant reviews, and the <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/demo/alchemylanguage" target="_blank">Alchemy Sentiment Analysis API</a> to analyze results for positive or negative content.</p>

		<p>With each restaurant search, results for relevant publications and blog reviews are scraped from Google search pages using a custom Ruby scraper. The scraper was created specifically for this project using Nokogiri combined with the Readability Parser API to break the article into title, content, author, etc.</p>

		<p>Article content is passed through the Alchemy Language API which analyzes the text and returns a postive or negative "Sentiment Analysis," which is calculated together to give it a total scores, which is compared against the Google Places and Yelp restaurant ratings.</p>
